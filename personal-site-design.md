# Sprint-3 | Personal Site Design

>Me he whare pūngāwerewere<br>
>*As intricate as a spiders web*<br>  

## 1. Purpose
[This site](http://joseph-code-eda.github.io) showcases the evolution of applied web development/design skills learned through [Dev Academy](http://devacademy.co.nz).

## 2. Target Audience
This website is primarily a compendium of sprints during Phase-0 of the EDA journey.
It can be used by my cohort peers and coaches to view progression; or by friends and whānau who are curious to see what becomes of this midlife crisis journey of discovery! 
Finally, this can also serve as a portfolio for any potential tech company seeking a gun for hire.

## 3. Interactive Experiences
Simplicity will be at the core of this website.
Aimed at a mobile device market - priority will be around touch-centric navigation.
In order to realize this, the design must be:
- Balanced
- Accessible
- Responsive

## 4. Building Utopia
>*Process over product

This particular sprint focuses on experiential learning, working collaboratively & communication rather than a perfect website.<br>
**Simple grid frameworks** will be used to maintain the theme of simplicity.<br>
Included considerations for improved performance are:
1. Limited images (1-2 only)
2. Limited type fonts (1-2 maximum)
3. Minimal navigation options
