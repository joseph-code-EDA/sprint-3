## So...what happened?
Can I start of by saying - what a massive, **MASSIVE** challenge this was for me...<br>
<br>
What I discovered when resizing the web browser is that the ***Skeleton CSS* makes any HTML responsive** - meaning if I shrink the browser size, the text, images and content shrink accordingly and vice versa.<br>
<br>
*Skeleton* is built upon a **12-column grid** that accommodates the majority, if not all web design layouts possible.<br>
<br>
At the core of *Skeletons* flexibility are **media queries** which are **Mobile-First** compliant and ensure that smaller devices need only download media queries relevant to them.<br>
<br>
After figuring out how to control page layouts via div columns, I was able to apply a few media queries directly to specific content.<br>
