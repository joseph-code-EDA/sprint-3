## So...what happened?
Can I start of by saying - what a massive, no **###MASSIVE** challenge this was for me...(still catching my breath...)<br>


## 2. Target Audience
This website is primarily a compendium of sprints during Phase-0 of the EDA journey.<br>
<br>
It can be used by my cohort peers and coaches to view progression; or by friends and whƒÅnau who are curious to see what becomes of this midlife crisis journey of discovery!<br>
<br>
Finally, this can also serve as a portfolio for any potential tech company seeking a gun for hire.
<br>

## 3. Interactive Experiences
Simplicity will be at the core of this website.<br>
<br>
Aimed at a mobile device market - priority will be around touch-centric navigation.<br>
<br>
In order to realize this, the design must be :
- Balanced
- Accessible
- Responsive
<br>

## 4. Building Utopia
>*Process over product*

This particular sprint focuses on experiential learning, working collaboratively & communication rather than producing a fully functional, aesthetically pleasing, 'perfect' website with all the bells & whistles.<br>
<br>
**Simple grid frameworks** will be used to maintain the theme of simplicity.<br>
<br>
Included considerations for improved performance are :

1.  Limited images (1-2 only)
2.  Limited type fonts (1-2) maximum
3.  Minimal navigation options
<br>
